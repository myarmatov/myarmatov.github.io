About
======

Hi! I'm Muhammetmyrat Yarmatov, a last year undergraduate student at the Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology ([UNIST](https://www.unist.ac.kr/)), majoring in [Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](http://ece.unist.ac.kr/). I am from Ashgabat, Turkmenistan that locates in the southwest of the central Asia region. Since 2017, I am living in Ulsan, South Korea.  



Interests
======
I am interested in understanding the fundamental concepts of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and applying that insight to build **fully autonomous and intelligent systems** (e.g., autonomous vehicles, smart manufacturing robots, service robots, etc.). For that purpose, I want to strengthen my knowledge and practical skills in the following areas.
**Computer Vision**: Autonomous systems should be able to recognize and understand their environment from what they see.
**Robotics**:
**Machine Learning**:
