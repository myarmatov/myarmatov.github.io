About
======

Hi! I'm Muhammetmyrat Yarmatov, a last year undergraduate student at the Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology ([UNIST](https://www.unist.ac.kr/)), majoring in [Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](http://ece.unist.ac.kr/). I am from Ashgabat, Turkmenistan that locates in the southwest of the central Asia region. Since 2017, I am living in Ulsan, South Korea.  



Interests
======
I am interested in understanding the fundamental concepts of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and applying that insight to build **fully autonomous and intelligent systems** (e.g., autonomous vehicles, smart manufacturing robots, service robots, etc.). For that purpose, I want to strengthen my knowledge and practical skills in integrating the following areas towards my goal.

**Computer Vision**: Intelligent systems should be able to recognize and understand their environment from what they see. Therefore, computer vision tasks such as 3D perception, object detection and classification, and action recognition are neccessary.

**Robotics**: Intelligent systems should be able to do decision-making and problem-solving accordingly. That's why, robotics tasks such as control, automated reasoning, mapping, and planning in dynamic, uncertain environments are important.

**Machine Learning**: The core requirement to make all the above-mentioned tasks more efficient and accurate is Machine Learning. Powerful Machine Learning and Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms need to be developed to build fully autonomous and intelligent systems.


Moreover, in the future, I want to build smart cities equipped with intelligent transportation systems. It will have a huge impact on sustainable urban development that will contribute to achieving at least three of the [UN's 17 Sustainable Development Goals to Transform Our World](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/).
