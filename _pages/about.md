About
======

Hi! I'm Muhammetmyrat Yarmatov, a last year undergraduate student at the Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology ([UNIST](https://www.unist.ac.kr/)), majoring in [Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](http://ece.unist.ac.kr/). I am conducting research in "AI, Robotics, and Transportation" lab, and working as a teaching assistant in the "Artificial Intelligence Programming" course at UNIST.



Interests
======
I am interested in understanding the fundamental concepts of <span style="color:darkcyan"> **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** </span> and applying that insight to build <span style="color:darkcyan"> **fully autonomous and intelligent systems** </span> (e.g., autonomous vehicles, smart manufacturing robots, service robots, etc.). For that purpose, I want to strengthen my knowledge and practical skills in integrating the following areas towards my interests.

<span style="color:darkcyan"> **Computer Vision** </span>: Intelligent systems should be able to recognize and understand their environment from what they see. Therefore, computer vision tasks such as 3D perception, object detection and classification, and action recognition are neccessary.

<span style="color:darkcyan"> **Robotics** </span>: Intelligent systems should be able to do decision-making and problem-solving accordingly. That's why, robotics tasks such as control, automated reasoning, mapping, and planning in dynamic, uncertain environments are important.

<span style="color:darkcyan"> **Machine Learning** </span>: The core requirement to make all the above-mentioned tasks more efficient and accurate is Machine Learning. Powerful Machine Learning and Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms need to be developed to build fully autonomous and intelligent systems.


Moreover, in the future, I want to build smart cities equipped with intelligent transportation systems. It will have a huge impact on sustainable urban development that will contribute to achieving at least three of the [UN's 17 Sustainable Development Goals to Transform Our World](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/).
