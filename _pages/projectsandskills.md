Current projects
======
* **Fault detection for autonomous vehicles**
* **3D Hand Pose Estimation**

Finished projects
======

* **Airport Service Robots:**
  * We built service robots that autonomously collect and distribute passenger trolleys in busy airports. I developed deep learning based computer vision algorithms that would enable robots to detect, classify, and track idle trolleys using state-of-the-art object detection architectures such as RCNN, Faster-RCNN, and YOLOv3. We collected data by outselves
* **Graduate Admissions Prediction:** 
  * I developed a model that estimates student's chance for getting admitted to the US universities based on their academic background. I used Machine Learning algorithms such as SVM, Random Forests, k-Nearest Neighbors for the prediction. Dataset from "The Grad Cafe" was used. Since dataset was so messy, results were not so good even though I did data pre-processing. Still, the best accuracy was achieved with SVM. 
* **Math Word Problem Solver:**
  * We made an application which can help primary school students to solve math word problems. Given the problem, the application solves it and show its answer and solution. We used various methods of NLP such as Named Entity Recognition, HMM, etc. with a powerful library for NLP: spaCy.
* **eDoctor:** 
  * I worked on diagnosing diseases that have similar symptoms such as cold, flu, and seasonal allergy. Since misdiagnosing those diseases outside of a medical setting can be fatal, I proposed a user-friendly mobile application as a solution to this problem which utilizes the classification algorithms in machine learning such as SVM, Decision Trees, and k-Nearest Neighbors to diagnose diseases based on usersâ€™ answers to guiding questions.
* **Smart Camera:**
  * I conducted research on video processing and feature extraction methods for surveillance cameras to make them smart enough to detect car accidents and immediately summon an ambulance to save lives.
